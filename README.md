# bsides-infobeamer

## Intro

Bsides Ljubljana is using [info-beamer.com](info-beamer.com) for displaying information on large TVs during the event. Information include schedule, sponsors, twitter wall, capture the flag score board (usualy https://ctf.viris.si/) , wall of sheep (https://www.wallofsheep.com/pages/wall-of-sheep).

In the past we used in house RPi solution, but it's more practical to use the same solution tha CCC congres is using [info-beamer.com](info-beamer.com)


## Hardware

First determine how many info walls you need. That depends on the venue and number of rooms.

For each info wall you need. Community will lend or finance the HW:

- High quality SD card (@brodul can lend it) (don't cheap out, we care about your mental health)
- Rpi with wifi RPi 3 or RPi4
- High quality power supply (don't cheap out, we care about your mental health)
- LED TV with HDMI (must have remote if it can only be turned on via remote)
- HDMI cable


## Information you need upfront

- Wifi SSID and password that will be used on the day of the event
- Who are the sponsors and how they are displayed:
  - e.g. gold sponsor ( full screen for 30 seconds)
  - silver sponsor (2 sponsors on screen for 30 seconds)
  - community sponsors (multiple (3) for 10 seconds )
- High quality logos of the sponsors/community sponsors

## Cost

Infobeamer is free for one device. Every next device is 0.25 EUR per day. Please don't use more than 1GB of storage as it consumes credits.  https://info-beamer.com/pricing
